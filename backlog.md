# Tasks to be done. Put emerging urgent and aspirational stuff here.

## [2025-08-27] Proposal: Generalize staged input pipeline via `useStagedModel`

**Context:**  
Current domain editors (e.g. `CircleProps`) implement a staged input model: props are received, edits are locally staged, and updates are committed explicitly. This pattern is semantically clean but currently duplicated across components.

**Proposal:**  
Sketch a reusable hook `useStagedModel(initialModel)` that encapsulates:

- Initial sync from props to local state
- Local mutation via controlled inputs
- Optional dirty tracking or reset logic
- Explicit commit interface (e.g. `getStagedModel()` or `commit()`)

**Benefits:**  

- Reduces boilerplate in domain editors  
- Preserves semantic clarity of staged editing  
- Enables future extensions (e.g. undo, validation, autosave)  
- Aligns with broader goal of composable, intention-revealing architecture

**Next Steps:**  

- Draft initial API surface for `useStagedModel`  
- Refactor `CircleProps` to use the hook  
- Evaluate generalization across other domain editors (e.g. parabola inputs)

**ðŸ”® Future Extensions:**

- `validate()` â†’ returns errors or validity
- `undo() / redo()` â†’ staged history
- `autosave()` â†’ debounce + commit
- `useStagedModel.withSchema(schema)` â†’ typed validation

> This entry formalizes the staged editing pattern as a reusable abstraction, paving the way for cleaner input pipelines and future extensibility.

- Tie "tick density" along x-axis to repayment frequency.

### ðŸªž Backlog Item: Shared Visual Grammar Capsule  

**Type:** Architectural Enhancement  
**Status:** Deferred  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Context:**  
Current styling across `LoanTermsProps` and `LoanSimulationOutcomeProps` is manually aligned but lacks a formalized shared grammar. Visual consistency is maintained ad hoc, without a composable abstraction.

**Intent:**  
Introduce a semantic styling capsule (e.g. `PropsGrid.module.css`) to unify layout primitives, label alignment, input treatment, and background theming across domain props components. Enable variant-based extension (e.g. `editable`, `readonly`, `highlighted`) while preserving authorial control.

**Notes:**  

- Consider FM-aligned naming for variants and layout roles.  
- Avoid premature abstractionâ€”only extract once 3+ components converge.  
- May benefit from scoped CSS modules or context-aware styling hooks.  
- Align with future mutation provenance indicators or semantic overlays.
