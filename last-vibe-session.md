Perfect timing for a commit‚Äîthis session has earned its place in the capsule. Here's the updated `last-vibe-session.md`, refined to reflect the latest behavioral insights and architectural clarifications. I‚Äôve trimmed redundant phrasing, clarified the lazy initialization fix, and added a note on Strict Mode impact. Let me know if you'd like it formatted differently for your tooling.

## üß† Context Capsule: Domain Detachment & Render Isolation Session (26 Aug 2025)

### ‚úÖ Goals Achieved

- **Extracted domain logic** from `NavBarTop` into `ParabolaInputs.jsx`, placed under `views/domain`
- **Refactored `NavBarTop`** into a structural shell accepting `children`, enabling domain injection
- **Rewired state**: introduced `committedParams` in `App.jsx` to gate rendering of `MainView`
- **Established shared state** between `ParabolaInputs` and `MainView`, with optional reactive behavior
- **Resolved React warning** by adding `key` props to `<text>` elements in SVG label array
- **Extracted parabola rendering logic** into `ParabolaRender.jsx`, isolating domain visualization
- **Lifted `a`, `b`, `c` into `params` object** for semantic encapsulation and domain-agnostic composition
- **Updated `MainView.jsx`** to host domain renderers via `{ params, trigger }` interface
- **Replaced eager state initialization** with lazy evaluation in `App.jsx` to prevent redundant domain computation
- **Confirmed React Strict Mode** as source of excessive render/debug calls; removed for stable behavior

### üß© Architectural Shifts

- `NavBar.jsx` composes `NavBarTop` and `NavBarBottom`, with `NavBarTop` parametrized via `children`
- `ParabolaInputs.jsx` handles domain-specific input logic, using `params` and `setParams`
- `App.jsx` lifts state and separates transient input (`params`) from committed render state (`committedParams`)
- `MainView.jsx` becomes a structural host for domain renderers, agnostic to content shape
- `ParabolaRender.jsx` encapsulates SVG rendering logic for parabola visualization

### üß≠ Behavioral Notes

- `params` updates immediately on input change; `committedParams` updates only on Init
- `trigger` remains relevant for manual re-rendering; could evolve into domain-specific `version` or `epoch`
- Lazy `useState(() => computeParabola(params))` prevents unintended recomputation on re-renders
- React Strict Mode (dev-only) causes double/triple invocation of render paths and initializers
- `MainView` supports polymorphic renderers via `{ params, trigger }` interface
- `ParabolaInputs` uses a DRY `handleChange` pattern keyed by param name
- `ParabolaRender` produces intention-revealing SVG with labeled tip and axis ticks

### üìÅ Updated File Roles

| File                     | Role                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ParabolaInputs.jsx`     | Domain input group for parabola parameters; updates shared state     |
| `ParabolaRender.jsx`     | Domain-specific SVG renderer for parabola visualization              |
| `NavBarTop.jsx`          | Structural wrapper for top navbar content; accepts domain children   |
| `NavBar.jsx`             | Composes top and bottom navbar sections; injects domain logic        |
| `MainView.jsx`           | Structural host for domain renderers; agnostic to content shape      |
| `App.jsx`                | Root component; lifts state, gates rendering, and wires layout       |

Brilliantly framed, Alexey. I‚Äôve added a final section to capture the memoization exploration and your decision to defer optimization in favor of forward momentum. It reflects both the architectural clarity you‚Äôve built and the philosophical stance you‚Äôre taking toward distraction and depth.

Here‚Äôs the appended section for `last-vibe-session.md`:

### üß† Memoization Exploration (Deferred)

- Investigated render cascade triggered by `dummyCircle` updates despite domain detachment
- Confirmed that `React.memo` and `useMemo` alone do not prevent re-renders when JSX children are reconstructed
- Identified `MainView` as a structural bottleneck‚Äîre-renders due to unstable child references
- Attempted memoization of `ParabolaRender`, `MainView`, and JSX subtree; confirmed limitations of shallow comparison
- Deferred optimization after recognizing premature memoization as a distraction from core utility
- Committed to revisiting render isolation once domain scaffolding and layout semantics are fully established
