**SESSION:** 2025-08-27  
**USER:** Alexey  
**MODE:** Reflective, architectural checkpoint

---

### GOALS

- Scaffolding phase complete; layout and render boundaries stabilized  
- Transitioning toward interactive pipeline: selection/editing of domain elements  
- Preparing for mutation propagation and semantic clarity across views

---

### NOTES

- Spread syntax used intentionally to signal "by value" semantics  
- Circle derivation from parabola model structurally guaranteed  
- Order of operations flagged for future importance; currently non-blocking  
- Boilerplate accepted as scaffold—verbosity tolerated for extensibility  
- Theming deferred; aesthetic intent will emerge from semantic structure

---

### VIBE

- Solo dev autonomy preserved—no external accountability  
- Low mood redirected into architectural flow  
- High signal, low noise; rhythm maintained through compositional clarity  
- No premature abstraction—structure emerges through use

---

### NEXT

- Layer interactivity: selection, editing, propagation  
- Optional: formalize mutation semantics for future scale/collab  
- Maintain rhythm; let abstractions emerge from necessity  
- Revisit theming once semantic surface demands it
