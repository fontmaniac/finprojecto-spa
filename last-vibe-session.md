Here’s what I’d capture in `last-vibe-session.md` to preserve the architectural rhythm and emotional contour of today’s session—ready to be rehydrated with minimal cognitive friction:

### `last-vibe-session.md`

**Session Date:** 2025-09-03  
**Author:** Alexey  
**Context Capsule:** FinprojectoSPA – LoanSimulationPlotlyRender.jsx  
**Session Mood:** Reflective, focused, mildly fatigued but architecturally satisfied

---

#### 🧠 Architectural Insight

- **Problem:** Mixing tall cumulative bars (e.g. loan balance, total repayments) with short per-slice deltas (e.g. interest, payment) led to visual incoherence and semantic dilution.
- **Resolution:** Reinstated the idea of **domain-split** using Plotly subplots.  
  → Tall values assigned to `yaxis` (top domain)  
  → Small deltas assigned to `yaxis2` (bottom domain)  
  → Both domains share the same `xaxis`, preserving horizontal alignment during zoom/pan.

#### 🔍 Deferred Thread

- **Highlighting logic** remains unresolved.  
  → Will revisit in a **constrained, scoped prototype**—possibly tomorrow.  
  → Needs tighter semantic boundaries and reduced trace count to test interactivity cleanly.

#### ✅ Achievements

- Reached semantic clarity in chart composition  
- Recovered and revalidated a previously rejected architectural idea  
- Maintained authorial intent and compositional rigor throughout

#### 🧭 Next Session Prompt

> “Let’s revisit highlightability in a minimal prototype.  
> One trace, one domain, one interaction.  
> Can we make it feel intentional?”
