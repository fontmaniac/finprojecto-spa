## 🧠 Context Capsule: Last Vibe Session — 2025-09-01

### 🧩 Architectural Progress

- Finalized display logic for `totalRepayments` and `offsetMatchPoint` using `toText(num)` and `toYears(num)` pipeline.
- Introduced `Intl.NumberFormat` for currency formatting and year rounding, with semantic fallback for missing values.
- Clarified behavior of `toFixed(n)`—standard rounding, returns string, used for year precision.
- Deferred pluralization and display suppression logic for fractional years—left open for future refinement.

### 📦 File Additions (from `for-ai.md`)

- `models/Definitions.js` — Common definitions
- `models/LoanSimulationModel.js` — Full loan lifecycle simulation
- `models/LoanTermsModel.js` — Terms model for loan calculator
- `views/domain/LoanSimulationOutcomeProps.jsx` — Outcome display
- `views/domain/LoanSimulationPlotlyRender.jsx` — Plotly visualisation
- `views/domain/LoanTermsProps.jsx` — Input UI for loan terms

### 📁 Updated Folder Structure

Reflected in `README.md`, with expanded modeling layer and domain render pipeline. Preserved semantic layout boundaries and compositional clarity.

### 🧠 Mental State

- Reflective and focused, with high architectural momentum.
- Satisfaction from semantic alignment and display clarity.
- Hopes high for next session—computation and visualisation foundations now solid.

### 🛠️ Next Likely Moves

- Layer mutation propagation across views.
- Formalize semantic capsules for display logic.
- Possibly introduce pluralization and conditional display suppression.
- Extend interactivity pipeline for FinprojectoSPA.
