### 🧠 **Session Capsule — 02 Sep 2025**

**Theme:** Referential stability and render semantics  
**Anchor Insight:** _“You cannot use something as a dependency without stabilizing it first.”_  
**Breakthrough:** Memoizing `onSliceSelect` resolved render-loop ambiguity, reinforcing the intuition that React’s dependency model hinges on identity, not shape.  
**Architectural Echo:** Recognized that closures and objects returned from render are inherently unstable—requiring memoization to negotiate layout authority and effect boundaries.  
**Philosophical Drift:** React’s rendering is a negotiation, not a command. Stability is not just optimization—it’s semantic clarity.  
**Mood:** Reflective, confident, and increasingly attuned to React’s rhythm.  
**Next Beat:** Consider how this stabilization principle informs context capsule export, mutation propagation, and simulation orchestration in FinprojectoSPA.
