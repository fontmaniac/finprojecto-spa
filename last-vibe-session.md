SESSION: 2025-08-27
USER: Alexey
MODE: Reflective, architectural checkpoint

GOALS:

- Confirmed scaffolding/boilerplate phase complete
- Transitioning toward interactive pipeline (selection/editing)

NOTES:

- Spread syntax used as semantic signal ("by value" intent)
- Circle derivation from parabola model is structurally guaranteed
- Order of operations currently non-critical, flagged for future importance
- Redundant spreads tolerable; convention may resolve ambiguity
- Boilerplate treated as scaffold—verbosity accepted for extensibility

VIBE:

- Solo dev freedom emphasized—no external accountability
- Low mood channeled into productive rhythm
- High signal, low noise; architectural clarity prioritized

NEXT:

- Begin layering interactivity
- Optional: formalize mutation semantics for future scale/collab
- Maintain rhythm, avoid premature abstraction
