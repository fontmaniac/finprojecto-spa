      Loan and Mortgage Calculator – Finprojecto.SPA
    </h1>
    <div id="preact-blurb">
      <p><strong>Finprojecto.SPA</strong> is a minimal, exploratory single-page application for simulating loan and mortgage
        repayments. It serves as a front-end scaffold for prototyping composable tools, semantic layout primitives, and
        domain-specific renderers in React.</p>

      <p><em>Disclaimer:</em> This application is intended for educational and experimental use only. It does not constitute
        financial advice, nor does it simulate real-world financial systems with production-grade fidelity. All computations
        and repayment calculations are client-side and illustrative.</p>

      <p>This is a living scaffold—not a finished product—and may evolve as new modeling domains and UI feedback mechanisms
        are explored.</p>

      <p><em>Note:</em> This project was developed independently by <strong>Fontmaniac</strong>, with modest architectural
        and debugging assistance from Microsoft Copilot (LLM). All design decisions and implementation choices reflect the
        author's intent and iterative refinement.</p>
