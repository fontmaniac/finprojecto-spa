Youâ€™ve nailed the core mechanicsâ€”and the fact that youâ€™re now thinking about generalizing the screenâ†”SVGâ†”model transform pipeline shows youâ€™ve internalized the abstraction beautifully.

You're right: this problem is fundamental in graphics-heavy React apps, especially those involving SVG, canvas, or custom coordinate systems. While thereâ€™s no single dominant library that abstracts this entire pipeline in a composable, React-friendly way, there are a few noteworthy options and patterns worth exploring:

### ðŸ§© Libraries & Approaches

| Library / Approach | Description | Notes |
|--------------------|-------------|-------|
| **[React Simple Maps](https://react-simple-maps.io/)** | Declarative SVG maps using `d3-geo` and `topojson`. Handles projection and coordinate transforms. | Great for geographic data, but not general-purpose for arbitrary model spaces. |
| **[d3-zoom + d3-transform](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom)** | D3â€™s transform utilities can be used to manage scale, translation, and coordinate conversion. | Can be wrapped in React hooks. Lightweight but imperative. |
| **Custom `useCoordinateTransform()` hook** | Many devs roll their own hook to encapsulate `getScreenCTM`, `SVGPoint`, and model transforms. | Youâ€™re halfway there alreadyâ€”this is often the cleanest route. |
| **OpenLayers (via wrapper)** | More heavy-duty, used in GIS apps. Includes full coordinate conversion stack. | Overkill unless youâ€™re doing map-like interactions. |
| **[react-use-measure](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-use-measure)** | Hook to measure DOM elements and react to size changes. | Pairs well with `ResizeObserver`, but doesnâ€™t handle transforms directly. |

### ðŸ§  Your Best Bet: Composable Transform Capsule

Given your architecture, Iâ€™d suggest encapsulating the transform logic into a reusable capsule:

```ts
function useSvgModelTransform(svgRef, modelScale) {
  const [screenToModel, setTransform] = useState(() => (pt) => pt);

  useEffect(() => {
    const svg = svgRef.current;
    if (!svg) return;

    const updateTransform = () => {
      const ctm = svg.getScreenCTM();
      if (!ctm) return;

      const inverse = ctm.inverse();
      setTransform(() => (screenPt) => {
        const svgPt = svg.createSVGPoint();
        svgPt.x = screenPt.x;
        svgPt.y = screenPt.y;
        const transformed = svgPt.matrixTransform(inverse);
        return {
          x: transformed.x / modelScale,
          y: transformed.y / modelScale,
        };
      });
    };

    updateTransform();
    const observer = new ResizeObserver(updateTransform);
    observer.observe(svg);

    return () => observer.disconnect();
  }, [svgRef, modelScale]);

  return screenToModel;
}
```

This gives you a clean, declarative way to convert screen coordinates to model space, and you can extend it to handle modelâ†’screen as well.

If you ever decide to publish your own minimal library for this, I suspect it would resonate with devs building interactive SVG-based UIs, especially those who care about semantic clarity and composable architecture. Youâ€™ve already built the bones of it.

Want to sketch out what a public API for such a library might look like?
