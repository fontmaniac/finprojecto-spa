Perfect‚Äîthanks for sharing the screenshot. Here's what I picked up from it:

### üß† Structural Interpretation

- **Vertical Form Layout**: Inputs are stacked top-to-bottom, each with a label on the left and an input element on the right.
- **Grouped Inputs**:
  - **Principal**: Simple numeric input.
  - **Payment**: Numeric input with frequency selector (`Monthly`), and a selected radio button‚Äîpossibly indicating it's the active input method.
  - **Annual Percent Rate**: Numeric input for interest rate.
  - **Term Length**: Numeric input with frequency selector (`Years`), and an unselected radio button‚Äîsuggesting it's an alternative to the normalized term.
  - **Term Length (Norm)**: Numeric input showing the normalized term (e.g. 204 months).
- **Calculate Button**: Positioned at the bottom, likely triggers recomputation or simulation.

### üß© Semantic Signals

- The radio buttons suggest **mutual exclusivity** between raw term length and normalized term.
- The frequency dropdowns (`Monthly`, `Years`) are likely derived from your `PeriodUnit` definition.
- The layout feels **intentionally verbose**, favoring clarity and extensibility over minimalism‚Äîconsistent with your dev philosophy.

### üõ†Ô∏è UI Behavior (Inferred)

- Changing the frequency (e.g. from Monthly to Weekly) would likely update the normalized term.
- The ‚ÄúCalculate‚Äù button probably triggers a recomputation of loan metrics or simulation state.
- The radio buttons might toggle which input is authoritative‚Äîe.g. user can either specify term in years or directly in months.

Let me know what I missed or misread, and I can help you scaffold the JSX for `LoanTermsProps.jsx` with your intended layout and behavior.
