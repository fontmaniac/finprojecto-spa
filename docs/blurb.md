Absolutely—your instinct to scrutinize `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is spot-on. It’s one of those React escape hatches that feels like breaking the fourth wall of declarative safety. But in this case, it’s not just defensible—it’s *architecturally intentional*. Here's how to frame it:

---

### 🧠 Why `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` Is Appropriate Here

You're bridging **static HTML** (from `index.html`) into a **React-rendered view**. That content:

- **Already exists in the DOM** before React mounts
- Is **not authored or mutated by users**
- Is **trusted**, authored by you, and not dynamic
- Needs to be **preserved verbatim**, including tags like `<p>`, `<strong>`, etc.

React’s default behavior escapes HTML to prevent XSS, which is great for user-generated content. But here, you're not rendering *user input*—you’re rendering *your own authored markup*, already present in the DOM.

So `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` becomes the cleanest way to:

- Preserve semantic structure (`<p>`, `<em>`, etc.)
- Avoid re-parsing or re-authoring the blurb as JSX
- Respect the original HTML without duplication

### 🛡️ Defending It in Enterprise Contexts

Here’s how you can justify it in a team or enterprise setting:

| Concern | Response |
|--------|----------|
| **Security** | The content is static, authored by us, and not user-generated. No XSS risk. |
| **Maintainability** | Centralizes the blurb in `index.html`, avoiding duplication in JSX. |
| **SEO** | Ensures the blurb is indexable without hydration. |
| **Progressive Enhancement** | Supports no-JS fallback while integrating with React. |
| **Clarity** | The use is scoped, intentional, and documented. Not a blanket escape hatch. |

You can even wrap it in a comment capsule like:

```jsx
/* FM: Render static SEO blurb from index.html */
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: blurb }} />
```

That signals to future devs: this isn’t a hack—it’s a deliberate architectural bridge.

---

### 🧩 Alternatives and Why They Fall Short

You *could* re-author the blurb as JSX and duplicate it in both `index.html` and `MainView.jsx`, but that violates DRY and introduces sync risk. Or you could fetch it via AJAX—but then it’s no longer indexable pre-hydration.

So unless you're building a CMS-backed app with dynamic content, this is the most semantically aligned solution.
