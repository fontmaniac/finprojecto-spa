Side question. Git. Asking for a friend, of course :) Let's say, I've been working locally only, committing to my local Git repository, and accumulated a substantial history. But - hypothetically - I've been lazy at times and neglectfully committed various PII, secrets and passwords into the repo (why not, it is local only and not accessible from anywhere, not even pushed onto any cloud services like GitHub/GitLab). But then I've had a change of heart and now want to make my repo publicly available on GitHub. I've obviously stripped all the implicating passwords, but Git history remembers all! And I want to preserve the history as much as possible. So, short of just recreating a repo and committing the latest incarnation project wholus bolus as a single commit, what tools (if any) exist to help to strip Git repo history off unwanted stuff?

Ah, the classic “asking for a friend” scenario—totally relatable 😄. Git’s memory is long and unforgiving, but thankfully, there are tools designed for precisely this kind of repentance arc.

### 🧹 Best Tool for the Job: `git filter-repo`

Forget the old `git filter-branch`—it’s deprecated and clunky. The modern, officially endorsed tool is [`git filter-repo`](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository). It’s fast, safe, and flexible.

Here’s how your “friend” can use it:

```bash
# Install filter-repo if not already installed
brew install git-filter-repo  # macOS
# or follow install instructions from GitHub

# Remove a specific file from all history
git filter-repo --invert-paths --path secrets.env --force
```

This command:

- Scans every commit
- Removes all traces of `secrets.env` (or whatever file contained the sensitive data)
- Rewrites history cleanly

You can also remove multiple files or patterns, like:

```bash
git filter-repo --invert-paths --path config/keys.json --path .env.local --force
```

### 🧠 Important Notes

- **Back up first**: Always clone your repo and test the rewrite on a copy.
- **Commit hashes will change**: This is a full history rewrite.
- **Force push required**: If you’ve already pushed to GitHub, you’ll need to `git push --force` after the cleanup.
- **Rotate secrets anyway**: Even if you scrub the history, revoke and rotate any exposed credentials. Git is persistent, but so are accidental clones.

### 🛡️ Prevention Going Forward

- Add sensitive files to `.gitignore` early
- Use environment variables or secret managers
- Consider tools like `git-secrets` or `trufflehog` to scan for leaks

If your “friend” wants to preserve most of the history but surgically remove only the offending commits, there are more advanced workflows using interactive rebase or commit filtering—but `git filter-repo` is the cleanest scalpel for the job.

Want help drafting a `.gitignore` or scanning for lingering secrets before the big GitHub reveal?

Totally understandable—your “friend” is just trying to keep things clean and professional before stepping into the public eye 😄. That kind of local-only script isn’t a security breach, but it does reveal internal setup and personal naming that might feel a bit... intimate once exposed.

### 🧼 Surgical Cleanup Options

If the goal is to preserve most of the repo’s history but quietly erase traces like that `copytovm` script, here are a few approaches:

---

#### 🛠 Option 1: Interactive Rebase (for recent commits)

If the commit is recent and not deeply buried:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~10  # or however many commits back you want to review
```

Then:

- Mark the commit with `edit`
- Modify `package.json` to remove the script
- `git commit --amend`
- Continue the rebase

This keeps history mostly intact while rewriting just the relevant commit.

---

#### 🧹 Option 2: `git filter-repo` (for deeper or multiple removals)

If it’s scattered across history or you want to remove all traces of that script:

```bash
git filter-repo --path package.json --replace-text <file>
```

Where `<file>` contains something like:

```
"copytovm": "scp -r ./dist/ alexey@192.168.1.6:/home/alexey/"==>
```

This replaces the exact string with nothing across all commits. You can also use regex if needed.

---

#### 🕵️ Option 3: Manual Rewrite + Fresh History

If you want to keep the code but not the history:

```bash
mkdir clean-repo
cd clean-repo
git init
cp -r ../old-repo/* .
git add .
git commit -m "Initial public commit"
```

This is the nuclear option—clean slate, no baggage.

### 🧠 Bonus: Pre-Publish Hygiene

Before pushing to GitHub:

- Run [`git log -p`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) and scan for anything sketchy
- Use [`trufflehog`](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) or [`git-secrets`](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) to scan for secrets
- Consider `.gitattributes` to mark files as linguistically or semantically sensitive (e.g., `export-ignore`)

If you want help crafting a `replace-text` file or scanning for other “low-level confessions,” I can help your friend tidy up before the big reveal.
