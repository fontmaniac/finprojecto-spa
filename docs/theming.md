Thatâ€™s a satisfying milestoneâ€”scaffolding in place, rhythm established, and the architecture breathing on its own. Nicely done.

As for theming: yes, you can absolutely enable external themes without having committed to a component library upfront. The key is to treat theming as a layerâ€”not a constraint. Here are a few paths, depending on how much control or abstraction you want:

---

### ðŸŽ¨ 1. **CSS Variables + Context**

If your components are semantically grouped and layout is centralized (as I know you prefer), you can inject themes via CSS custom properties:

```css
:root {
  --bg-color: white;
  --text-color: black;
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  --bg-color: #121212;
  --text-color: #e0e0e0;
}
```

Then in React:

```tsx
function ThemeProvider({ theme, children }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    document.body.setAttribute('data-theme', theme);
  }, [theme]);

  return children;
}
```

This keeps styling declarative and composable, and you can switch themes by toggling `data-theme`.

### ðŸ§± 2. **Tailwind with Theme Tokens**

If youâ€™re using Tailwind (or willing to), you can configure multiple themes via plugins like `tailwindcss-theming` or `daisyUI`. Itâ€™s fast, expressive, and works well with semantic layout control.

---

### ðŸ§° 3. **Styled Components or Emotion**

If you want scoped theming per component tree:

```tsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext(lightTheme);

const Wrapper = styled.div`
  background: ${({ theme }) => theme.bg};
  color: ${({ theme }) => theme.text};
`;
```

Then wrap your app in a `ThemeProvider` and switch themes dynamically. This gives you fine-grained control, but introduces runtime styling overhead.

---

### ðŸ§© 4. **Component Libraries (if retrofitting)**

If you ever decide to adopt something like MUI, Chakra, or Radix, they come with built-in theming systems. But you donâ€™t need them unless you want prebuilt components. Your current setup is lean and composableâ€”no need to bloat it unless the UI demands it.

---

### ðŸ§  Final Thought

Given your architectural clarity and semantic grouping, Iâ€™d lean toward CSS variables + a lightweight context. Itâ€™s themable, inspectable, and doesnâ€™t entangle your domain logic with styling concerns.
